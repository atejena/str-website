# Draft Message for Spencer

---

Hey Spencer,

The website is fully built and live. Here's where things stand and what I need from you to button everything up.

**Your site:** https://str-website-kappa.vercel.app
**Admin panel:** https://str-website-kappa.vercel.app/admin
Login: admin@str.com / admin123

Everything on the site is manageable from the admin panel, no coding needed. You can update classes, trainers, pricing, blog posts, testimonials, gallery photos, FAQs, careers, and all your settings from there.

**What I need from you:**

1. **Real photos** — Go to Admin → Gallery and upload your gym photos. There's a Bulk Upload option that lets you upload up to 20 at a time. The site currently has placeholder stock images that need to be swapped out.

2. **Phone number** — I need a business phone number to display on the site. It's also required for SMS compliance if you're using GoHighLevel for text messaging.

3. **GoHighLevel info:**
   - Your GHL chat widget ID (for the chat bubble on the site)
   - If you want your forms to be GHL forms, send me the embed URLs for your Get Started form and Contact form. I can plug those right in from the admin settings.

4. **TrainHeroic** — If you want the /programming page to show your daily whiteboard, go to Admin → Settings → Integrations and paste your TrainHeroic whiteboard embed URL.

5. **Social media links** — Go to Admin → Settings and add your Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok URLs so they show up in the footer and contact page.

6. **Business hours** — Verify your hours are correct in Admin → Settings. Currently set to Mon-Fri 5am-9pm, Sat-Sun 7am-2pm.

7. **Review Terms of Service and Privacy Policy** — Both are editable from Admin → Settings (scroll to the bottom). You'll want to review them and add any SMS/texting language if you're sending texts through GHL. This is required for A2P compliance.

8. **Google Analytics** — If you have a GA4 tracking ID (starts with G-), add it in Admin → Settings → Integrations.

9. **Domain** — When you're ready, we'll connect trainwithstr.com to the live site. I just need access to wherever your domain DNS is managed (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.).

**What's already working:**
- All pages are live and mobile friendly
- Google Reviews are pulling in (you have 6 five-star reviews showing)
- SMS consent language is on all forms (A2P compliant)
- Dark mode / light mode toggle
- SEO is set up with structured data for Google
- The admin panel gives you full control over all content

Let me know if you have questions on any of this. Once you get me the items above, we're basically at the finish line.
